    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently a first-year student in Finland, pursuing a Bachelor's 
        Degree in Information and Communication Technology. <br>
    
        Eager to immerse myself in the industry, I am seeking opportunities to 
        commence work while continuing my academic pursuits. My ultimate goal is 
        to establish myself as a top professional in the field by the time I 
        graduate.<br><br>
        
        Over the past ten years, I have amassed significant experience working 
        as an electrician for various companies. My responsibilities have been 
        diverse, ranging from roles such as a Crane Electrical Control Systems 
        Installer to serving as an electrical foreman on construction sites. 
        At my peak, I successfully managed a team of 15 individuals.<br><br>
        
        I have observed numerous parallels between electrical control systems 
        and the principles of information and communication technology. This 
        background gives me confidence in my transition and enhances my prospects 
        for becoming a leading professional in the technology industry.</p>
